| [Distribute](shaperange.distribute-method-publisher.md)|Evenly distributes the shapes in the specified shape range.|
| [Duplicate](shaperange.duplicate-method-publisher.md)|Creates a duplicate of the specified  **[Shape](shape-object-publisher.md)** or **[ShapeRange](shaperange-object-publisher.md)** object, adds the new shape or range of shapes to the **Shapes** collection immediately after the shape or range of shapes specified originally, and then returns the new **Shape** or **ShapeRange** object.|
| [Flip](shaperange.flip-method-publisher.md)|Flips the specified shape around its horizontal or vertical axis, or flips all the shapes in the specified shape range around their horizontal or vertical axes.|
| [GetHeight](shaperange.getheight-method-publisher.md)|Returns the height of the shape or shape range as a  **Single** in the specified units.|
| [GetLeft](shaperange.getleft-method-publisher.md)|Returns the distance of the shape's or shape range's left edge from the left edge of the leftmost page in the current view as a  **Single** in the specified units.|
| [GetTop](shaperange.gettop-method-publisher.md)|Returns the distance of the shape's or shape range's top edge from the top edge of the leftmost page in the current view as a  **Single** in the specified units.|
| [GetWidth](shaperange.getwidth-method-publisher.md)|Returns the width of the shape or shape range as a  **Single** in the specified units. .|
| [Group](shaperange.group-method-publisher.md)|Groups the shapes in the specified shape range. Returns the grouped shapes as a single  **[Shape](shape-object-publisher.md)** object.|
| [IncrementLeft](shaperange.incrementleft-method-publisher.md)|Moves the specified shape or shape range horizontally by the specified distance.|
| [IncrementRotation](shaperange.incrementrotation-method-publisher.md)|Changes the rotation of the specified shape around the z-axis (extends outward from the plane of the publication) by the specified number of degrees.|
| [IncrementTop](shaperange.incrementtop-method-publisher.md)|Moves the specified shape or shape range vertically by the specified distance.|
| [Item](shaperange.item-method-publisher.md)|Returns an individual object in a specified collection.|
| [MoveIntoTextFlow](shaperange.moveintotextflow-method-publisher.md)|Moves a given shape into the text flow defined by  ** [TextRange Object](textrange-object-publisher.md)**. The shape will always be inserted inline at the beginning of the text flow.|
| [MoveOutOfTextFlow](shaperange.moveoutoftextflow-method-publisher.md)|Moves a given inline shape out of its containing text range, defined by  ** [TextRange Object](textrange-object-publisher.md)**, and makes the shape fixed.|

| [RerouteConnections](shaperange.rerouteconnections-method-publisher.md)|Reroutes connectors so that they take the shortest possible path between the shapes they connect. To do this, the  **RerouteConnections** method may detach the ends of a connector and reattach them to different connecting sites on the connected shapes.|
| [SaveAsBuildingBlock](shaperange.saveasbuildingblock-method-publisher.md)|Saves a single shape range as a building block. Returns the resulting  **[BuildingBlock](buildingblock-object-publisher.md)** object.|
| [SaveAsPicture](shaperange.saveaspicture-method-publisher.md)|Saves a range of one or more shapes as a picture file.|
| [ScaleHeight](shaperange.scaleheight-method-publisher.md)|Scales the height of the shape by a specified factor. For pictures and OLE objects, you can indicate whether you want to scale the shape relative to the original size or relative to the current size.|
| [ScaleWidth](shaperange.scalewidth-method-publisher.md)|Scales the width of the shape by a specified factor. For pictures and OLE objects, you can indicate whether you want to scale the shape relative to the original size or relative to the current size.|
| [Select](shaperange.select-method-publisher.md)|Selects the specified object.|
| [SetShapesDefaultProperties](shaperange.setshapesdefaultproperties-method-publisher.md)|Applies the formatting for the specified shape or shape range to the default shape. Shapes created after this method has been used will have this formatting applied to them by default.|

If the specified shape is a picture or OLE object, Microsoft Publisher will break it apart and convert it to an ungrouped set of shapes.
